Pre-requisite:
is that you need to install Node.js to your computer
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

open Windows terminal or VScode terminal or whichever terminal you're using
T: , C: , D:
to switch drive

Go to cd where you code is located
example > go to T: drive:    T: , Copy Path of your code location , continue to install V

npm install gulp gulp-cli browser-sync
npm install -g gulp-cli

^ this is like Open Live Server on VSCode but not a plugin

Whenever you launch your browser sync go to the directory where your code is and the gulpfile.js


node -v  < Checks version

create gulpfile.js

create .gitignore 
add node_modules to .gitignore

in Terminal type gulp serve

to cancel the server click crtl + c

git status

git add . <-- adds all the file changes you want to make.

git commit -m "Comment about your Commit"

git push  <--- Pushes Code and Commit to github or whichever repo you're connected to.

refresh github repo and you're set.

cd ..               <- goes up a folder

code . <---- opens up a vs code instance


init, add, commit, status, push, pull, merge, branch... covers 90% of use cases
